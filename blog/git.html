      What are the benefits of version control?
      -Version control is necessary to keep track of your work and saves them at the moment in time (commit) so that they're preserved and allowed to be revisited. It's important for developers to use version control to keep track of any changes and so that they can go back to these commits whenever they need to, either for fixing something or for research.

      How does Git help you keep track of changes?
      Git is a software that you can install on your local machine for version control. It allows you to keep track of your code. You can take snapshots of your work (called commits) so you know what changes were implemented and when (and by whom).
      They are like save points at any stage of your work. It's important to see a complete history of the software.

      Why use GitHub to store your code?
        Github allows access to software, remotely. You can share and store whatever you made in Git on githubl Github is very useful because it allows for real time collaboration on anything from different users in remote locations. While git is on your local machine, github allows remote access from anywhere.
