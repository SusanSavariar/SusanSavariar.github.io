  <h1>Week 3: CSS</h1>
 <p>For this assignment we were instructed to choose a topic to research and then write about it. I chose to research the difference between margin, border, and padding.</p>

<p>Padding is what exists between the content of a block and the border, the margin is what exists between the border and the edge of the block, and the border is what is in the middle. All three of these things can be non-existent, or they can have a thickness which can be specified using two different methods. Borders and padding can have a background, but the margin is transparent and will show whatever background it overlaps.</p>

<p>You can specify margin or padding on each side of the block individually, or all on one line. When the margin or padding is specified all on one line, the first number is the top and then rotates clockwise to right, bottom, and left.</p>
